		Backstory={
			As an ancient pixie I do not recall my exact age, but I'm at least several hundred years old. I also do not remember my true home, only that it was a place of peace and joy. For decades though I was impisoned under the cruel pirate captain Webster 'Splinter' Salvotor.\\
			Only thirteen years ago a young Aasimar by the name of Vulrun saved me from my fate. Since then I accompinied him on his missions. During that time we forged a strong \textbf{empathetic bond}. Thanks to that we were an unbeaten team on the battlefield.\\
			And so it happened, that we fought at the battle of Bestburg, when the Shadowfell attacked. As we tried to close a gate to the Shadowfell from the inside, it closed behind us, leaving us stranded there. With no immediate escape in sight, we kept together and adapted to a life in darkness. For over seven years we tried to get back to the mortal world.\\
			Then a year ago during our investigations in the city of Gloomwrought we heard about shadow crossings on the Monshae Isles. We searched Gwynneth for crossings, but when we finally found one it was already closing and to small for Vulrun to fit through it. He asked me to leave him behind. When I refused, he pushed me through it staying behind in the Shadowfell.
