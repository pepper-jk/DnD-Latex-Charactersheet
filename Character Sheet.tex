			Even though Nelly is mostly human in appearance, one would see her as a faun at first sight.
			Her \textbf{nose bears the likeness of a deers} and her \textbf{chestnut brown shoulder long hair} is coronated by \textbf{antlers}.
			Her \textbf{brown eyes} don't help with this mistaking either.
			Once an observer gets past her \textbf{feywild gifts} though, it is easy to see her for the \textbf{fey-touched human} she is.\\
			\\
			Nelly wears a green blouse and grey pants underneath her tightly wrapped buckskin armor.
			She carries a leather backpack, a wooden staff and, a longbow.
			Both the staff and bow are engraved with runes and the bow is crested with a small ruby in the middle of its handle.
			Above her cloths but beneath her leather armor she carries a white feather of a swan on a leather band around her neck.

		Backstory={
			\tiny
			Nelly grew up in a small village close to the edge of a forest.
			There her parents had a small house.
			Her father was a hunter and her mother was proficiencies in herbalism.
			She used to craft potions, salves and, small tinctures, which she sold along with meat from the hunt at the market.
			Since an early age Nelly was trained in their crafts.
			When her father died, she had to pick up his bow at a young age in order to provide the now missing income.\\
			After a while the young gifted hunter became famous in the small community and the teenage archer was invited to a marksmen's festival held be the nearby lord.
			Quickly she learned that earning money that way was easier than with hunting alone.
			Despite her mothers doubts Nelly choose to travel to further away festivals, but always returned home to bring money back.\\
			As Nelly grew older the time between the visits increased, as did the amount of gold she brought back.
			Eventually her mother had sold the house and married another merchant, who was newly widowed.
			After this last visit Nelly left her home village for good.
			Still a young adult she started traveling further than ever before.
			Visiting big cities and exploring deep forests.
			Until she met the swan maidens.\\
			\\
			The first time Nelly set foot into a clearing inhabited by fey, she became bewitched by the little creatures.
			However it did not take long for a swan maiden to confront the intruder.
			After proofing her worth and loyalty over the course of months and years Nelly was sworn in to the sorority.
			Nelly learned about the feywild, archfey and, the conflict between Titania, the Fairyqueen, and her evil sister, the Queen of Air and Darkness.\\
			\\
			After reading an ancient tome about the last war with the queen of air and darkness, her methods and powers, Nelly decided the sorority was not powerful enough to stop the dark queen a second time.\\
			She joined the adventuring guild in hopes to improve her skills and find magic relics to help in the fight.\\
			While she is traveling she is always eager to find new allies in the long term too.\\
