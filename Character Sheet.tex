		Appearance={
			%wie das blühende leben aussehen.
			Zinlee is an agile cute little Pixie dressed in leather armor and cloths of vivid colors matching common flowers. She normally looks in the pink, but her journey through the Shadowfell drained on her body and mind. Her appearancee started to fade into shades of grey.\\
			She carries a moldy shield she found in the Shadowfell on the battlefield of Bestburg and engraved it with Naralis Analors white dove. For ranged combat she wields a miniaturized shortbow and for close combat a dagger, which is more of a shortsword relative to her.
		},
		Backstory={
			As an ancient pixie I do not recall my exact age, but I'm at least several hundred years old. I also do not remember my true home, only that it was a place of peace and joy. For decades though I was impisoned under the cruel pirate captain Webster 'Splinter' Salvotor.\\
			Only thirteen years ago a young Aasimar by the name of \textbf{Vulrun} saved me from my fate. Since then I accompinied him on his missions. During that time we forged a strong \textbf{empathetic bond}. Thanks to that we were an unbeaten team on the battlefield.\\
			And so it happened, that we fought at the battle of Bestburg, when the Shadowfell attacked. As we tried to close a gate to the Shadowfell from the inside, it closed behind us, leaving us stranded there. With no immediate escape in sight, we kept together and adapted to a life in darkness. For over seven years we tried to get back to the mortal world.\\
			Then a year ago during our investigations in the city of Gloomwrought we heard about shadow crossings on the Monshae Isles. We searched Gwynneth for crossings, but when we finally found one it was already closing and to small for Vulrun to fit through it. He asked me to leave him behind. When I refused, he pushed me through it staying behind in the Shadowfell.

			Left={
				Zinlees most precious ally is Vulrun, the Aasimar she spend the last thirteen years with. He saved her from pirates, gave her a place to life and protected her during their time in the Shadowfell. She returned the favor by healing him, scouting, keeeping him company and brightening his days in the darkness of the Shadowfell.\\
				Even after her time in the Shadowfell her believe in \textbf{Naralis Analor} is still unfaltered. He stood by her during her years of captivity by Captain Webster 'Splinter' Salvotor. In Zinlees eyes her god prevented her death during that time.

		Traits={
			Left={
				Zinlee has not realized her discoloration through the occasinal glances at her reflection in the dark waters of the Shadowfell. Thus she is partly unaware of her greyish baggage, but also partly uninteressted in her appearance, due to her longing for a way back to the material plane.\\
				Her mind is dull, making her slowly to react, when spoken to, at times. This effect is not as common with her as it was with Vulrun, but even Pixies are not free from the Shadowfells influence.
